go build main.go
// compiles an executable file

go run main.go
// compiles an executable file and executes file

"package main"
// package == project == workspaces
// package = common code source files

why "main"?
// executable vs reusable
// exec: generates a file that we can run vs
// reus: code used as "helpers", "code dependencies", "utils"

"main" defines the executable package type, any other name won't generate an executable file when using "go build"

main -> executable package
/any other name/ -> reusable package

File Organization:

package declaration

import other packages that we need

declare functions, do things, etc.
